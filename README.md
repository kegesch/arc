# ARC

**Architecture, Requirements, Assumptions, Decisions** — traceability for humans and agents.

A CLI tool that tracks architectural decisions, requirements, and assumptions as a linked graph. Detect contradictions, find orphans, trace impact, and validate assumptions — all in text files you can commit to git.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @kegesch/arc
```

Or with bun:

```bash
bun install -g @kegesch/arc
```

## Quick Start

```bash
arc init                # Create .arc/ in your project
arc add requirement "All data must be encrypted at rest"
arc add assumption "Users will have fewer than 1000 records"
arc add decision "Use SQLite for local storage"
arc add idea "Use CRDTs for real-time sync"
arc add decision "Use Stripe for payments" --context billing
arc trace D-001          # See what backs a decision
arc impact A-001         # See what breaks if an assumption is wrong
arc check                # Find orphans, contradictions, dangling refs, gaps
arc next                 # What should I work on?
arc context R-001        # Bundle entity with implementation context
arc list --context billing  # List entities in the billing context
```

## Concepts

### Entities

| Type             | Prefix   | What it is                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requirement**  | `R-001`  | Something the system must satisfy                           |
| **Assumption**   | `A-001`  | Something believed true but not yet verified                |
| **Decision**     | `D-001`  | An architectural or design choice                           |
| **Idea**         | `I-001`  | A speculative thought or possibility — not yet committed to |
| **Stakeholder**  | `S-001`  | A person, team, or group with interest in the system        |
| **Risk**         | `K-001`  | Something that could go wrong — tracked and mitigated       |
| **Term**         | `T-001`  | A shared vocabulary definition (ubiquitous language)        |
| **Use Case**     | `UC-001` | A structured use case with actors, flows, and criteria      |
| **Entity Model** | `EM-001` | A structured domain model with entities and relationships   |

### Relationships

```
Requirement ──drives──▶ Decision         (decision driven_by requirement)
Assumption ──drives──▶ Decision          (decision driven_by assumption)
Requirement ◀──derived_from── Requirement (decomposition)
Requirement ◀──▶ conflicts_with          (mutual contradiction)
Assumption ──promoted_to──▶ Requirement  (validated assumption → requirement)
Decision ──enables──▶ Decision           (layered decisions)
Decision ──supersedes──▶ Decision        (replacing old decisions)
Idea ──inspired_by──▶ Any Entity         (what sparked the idea)
Idea ──inspired_by──▶ Idea               (idea building on idea)
Idea ──promoted_to──▶ Requirement/Decision (graduated to something concrete)
Requirement ──requested_by──▶ Stakeholder (who asked for this)
Decision ──affects──▶ Stakeholder (who is affected by this)
Risk ──mitigated_by──▶ Decision (what addresses this risk)
Use Case ──derived_from──▶ Requirement (which requirement it implements)
Use Case ──requested_by──▶ Stakeholder (who participates)
Entity Model ──derived_from──▶ Requirement (which requirement it models)
```

### Key Queries

- **Trace** — Walk the graph from any entity. "What backs this decision?"
- **Impact** — Reverse traversal. "If this assumption is wrong, what breaks?"
- **Next** — Categorize requirements by readiness. "What should I work on?"
- **Context** — Bundle entity with related context. "Everything I need to implement this."
- **Orphans** — Decisions with no backing requirement or assumption.
- **Contradictions** — Requirements that conflict with each other.
- **Ideas** — Speculative thoughts not yet committed to. Excluded from strict checks.
- **Dangling refs** — References to entities that don't exist.

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders represent the **who** — teams, roles, or groups that have an interest in the system. They answer "who asked for this?" and "who's affected by this change?"

```bash
arc add stakeholder "Warehouse operations team" --context fulfillment
arc add stakeholder "Finance department" --context billing
arc link R-001 S-001 --type requested_by   # Requirement requested by stakeholder
arc link D-003 S-002 --type affects        # Decision affects stakeholder
```

Stakeholders appear in `arc trace` and `arc impact`, so you can see not just what backs a decision but who cares about it.

### Contexts

Entities can be assigned a **context** to group them by domain area (e.g. `billing`, `fulfillment`, `auth`). Contexts are optional — use them when your project grows beyond a flat list.

```bash
arc add requirement "PCI compliance" --context billing
arc add decision "Use Stripe" --context billing
arc list --context billing       # Show only billing entities
arc check --context billing      # Check only billing entities
arc query "context:billing"      # Search by context
```

`arc status` shows a breakdown of entities per context when contexts are in use.

### Assumption Lifecycle

```
unvalidated ──▶ validated ──▶ (promoted to requirement)
     │
     └──▶ invalidated ──▶ (cascade: flag dependent decisions)
```

### Idea Lifecycle

```
explore ──▶ parked       (interesting but not now)
    │
    ├──▶ promoted ──▶ (promoted to requirement or decision)
    │
    └──▶ rejected    (explored and discarded)
```

### Stakeholder Lifecycle

```
active ──▶ inactive   (no longer involved)
```

### Risks

Risks represent what could go wrong. They track threats, their likelihood, and what's being done about them. A risk with `mitigated_by` links to decisions that address it.

```bash
arc add risk "Payment provider downtime during peak hours"
arc link K-001 D-005 --type mitigated_by   # Decision D-005 mitigates risk K-001
```

### Use Cases

Use cases describe how actors interact with the system to achieve a goal. They have structured fields for code generation:

```bash
arc add use_case "Search catalog" --context library
# Then edit to add actors, preconditions, main_flow, acceptance_criteria
arc link UC-001 R-001 --type derived_from  # Links to parent requirement
arc link UC-001 S-001 --type requested_by  # Links to participating stakeholder
```

Use cases have structured YAML frontmatter fields:

- `actors` — Who participates (string array)
- `preconditions` — What must be true before (string array)
- `main_flow` — Numbered steps with actor and action
- `acceptance_criteria` — Given/When/Then criteria (string array)

### Entity Models

Entity models describe domain entities, their attributes, and relationships:

```bash
arc add entity_model "Book library domain model" --context library
# Then edit to add entities with attributes and relationships
arc link EM-001 R-001 --type derived_from  # Links to parent requirement
```

Entity models have structured YAML frontmatter fields:

- `entities` — Array of domain entities
  - Each entity has `name`, `attributes` (name, type, required, unique, length), and `relationships` (target, type)

Risks appear in `arc impact` — if a mitigating decision is deprecated, you'll see the risk become unmitigated.

### Risk Lifecycle

```
identified ──▶ mitigated   (decision addresses it)
     │
     ├──▶ accepted    (acknowledged, not mitigating)
     │
     ├──▶ materialized (it happened)
     │
     └──▶ closed      (no longer relevant)
```

### Glossary (Terms)

Terms define the project's shared vocabulary — the ubiquitous language. They prevent the most common source of contradictions: different people meaning different things by the same word.

```bash
arc add term "Order" --context billing
arc add term "Fulfillment" --context fulfillment
```

Terms have no outgoing relationships — they exist as reference definitions. Any entity can reference a term by ID in its body.

### Term Lifecycle

```
draft ──▶ accepted    (the team agrees on this definition)
     │
     └──▶ deprecated (no longer used, replaced by another term)
```

## File Format

Each entity is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: D-001
title: "Use SQLite for local storage"
status: accepted
date: 2026-04-30
tags: [storage, database]
driven_by: [R-001, A-003]
context: storage
---

# Decision: Use SQLite for local storage

## Context

We need local persistence that works offline and doesn't require a server.

## Decision

Use SQLite as the embedded database.

## Consequences

- Single file, easy to version and backup
- No concurrent write support across processes
```

## Architecture

- **Text files as source of truth** — Markdown + YAML frontmatter, git-friendly
- **In-memory graph** — Parsed on every command (instant for repo-scale: <10k entities)
- **No database** — The filesystem IS the database
- **Structured query with fuzzy matching** — Token scoring, not LLM
- **One per repo** — `.arc/` lives in the project root, committed alongside code

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev -- init          # Run during development
bun test                     # Run tests
bun run build                # Compile to standalone binary
```
