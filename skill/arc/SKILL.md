# ARC — Architecture, Requirements, Assumptions, Decisions

ARC is a CLI tool that maintains a linked graph of architectural decisions, the requirements that drive them, and the assumptions that underpin them. All data lives in markdown files committed to git. Use it to keep your reasoning traceable, find contradictions, and ensure nothing is built on shaky ground.

## Setup

Before using ARC commands, ensure the project has been initialized:

```bash
# If .arc/ doesn't exist yet
arc init
```

The `.arc/` directory will be created in the project root. Commit it to git — it lives alongside code.

## When to Use This Skill

|                                                                      | Situation             | Action |

| User wants to visualize the full graph                               | `arc graph`           |

## Core Concepts

### Ten entity types

- **Requirement** (R-xxx) — Something the system must satisfy. Source of truth for what and why.
- **Assumption** (A-xxx) — Something believed true but not verified. Dangerous when wrong. Can be promoted to a requirement once validated.
- **Decision** (D-xxx) — An architectural or design choice. Should always trace back to requirements and/or assumptions.
- **Idea** (I-xxx) — A speculative thought or possibility, not yet committed to. Can be promoted to a requirement or decision when it crystallizes.
- **Stakeholder** (S-xxx) — A person, team, or group with interest in the system. Answers "who asked for this?" and "who is affected?".
- **Risk** (K-xxx) — Something that could go wrong. Tracked and mitigated via decisions.
- **Term** (T-xxx) — A shared vocabulary definition (ubiquitous language). Prevents ambiguity.
- **Use Case** (UC-xxx) — A structured use case with actors, preconditions, main flow, and acceptance criteria. Derives from requirements and links to stakeholders.
- **Entity Model** (EM-xxx) — A structured domain model with entities, attributes, and relationships. Derives from requirements.
- **Vision** (V-xxx) — The project purpose and direction. The root of the graph. Every requirement should trace up to a vision through the `derived_from` chain. Typically one per project.

### Relationships

```
Requirement ──drives──▶ Decision          driven_by
Assumption ──drives──▶ Decision           driven_by
Requirement ◀──derived_from── Requirement decomposition
Requirement ◀──▶ conflicts_with           contradiction
Assumption ──promoted_to──▶ Requirement   validation outcome
Decision ──enables──▶ Decision            layered decisions
Decision ──supersedes──▶ Decision         replacement
Idea ──inspired_by──▶ Any Entity          what sparked it
Idea ──inspired_by──▶ Idea                idea building on idea
Idea ──promoted_to──▶ Requirement/Decision graduation
Requirement ──requested_by──▶ Stakeholder  who asked for this
Decision ──affects──▶ Stakeholder          who is affected
Risk ──mitigated_by──▶ Decision            what addresses this risk
Use Case ──derived_from──▶ Requirement     which requirement it implements
Use Case ──requested_by──▶ Stakeholder     who participates
Entity Model ──derived_from──▶ Requirement which requirement it models
Requirement ──derived_from──▶ Vision          pillar requirements link to vision
```

Every decision should have at least one `driven_by` reference. Decisions without backing are "orphans" — a code smell.

### Assumption lifecycle

```
unvalidated → validated → (promoted to requirement)
    │
    └→ invalidated → (cascade: flag dependent decisions as at risk)
```

### Idea lifecycle

```
explore → parked       (interesting but not now)
    │
    ├──→ promoted     (graduated to requirement or decision)
    │
    └──→ rejected     (explored and discarded)
```

### Stakeholder lifecycle

```
active → inactive   (no longer involved)
```

### Risk lifecycle

```
identified → mitigated   (decision addresses it)
    │
    ├──→ accepted    (acknowledged, not mitigating)
    │
    ├──→ materialized (it happened)
    │
    └──→ closed      (no longer relevant)
```

### Term lifecycle

```
draft → accepted    (the team agrees on this definition)
    │
    └──→ deprecated (no longer used, replaced by another term)
```

### Vision lifecycle

```
active → retired   (project has pivoted or vision is no longer relevant)
```

No draft state. A vision is a committed statement — if you're still exploring, use an Idea (I-xxx) and promote it when ready.

Ideas are **non-binding**: they don't appear in strict `arc check` results (no orphan warnings, no contradiction checks). Use them to capture speculative thoughts without ceremony.

**Always surface unvalidated assumptions.** An accepted decision backed by an unvalidated assumption is fragile. Encourage the user to validate or promote assumptions early.

## Workflow

### 1. Initialize the project

```bash
arc init
```

Creates `.arc/` with subdirectories: `requirements/`, `assumptions/`, `decisions/`, `ideas/`, `stakeholders/`, `risks/`, `terms/`.

### 2. Add entities

```bash
# Requirements — what the system must do
arc add requirement "All data must be encrypted at rest" --status=accepted --tags=security

# Assumptions — what you believe to be true
arc add assumption "Users will have fewer than 1000 records" --tags=scale

# Decisions — architectural choices, linked to what drives them
arc add decision "Use SQLite for local storage" --status=accepted --driven-by="R-001,A-001"

# Ideas — speculative thoughts, linked to what inspired them
arc add idea "Use CRDTs for real-time sync" --inspired-by="D-001" --tags=sync

# Stakeholders — who cares about this system
arc add stakeholder "Warehouse operations team" --context=fulfillment
arc add stakeholder "Finance department" --context=billing

# Risks — what could go wrong
arc add risk "Payment provider downtime during peak hours" --context=billing

# Terms — shared vocabulary definitions
arc add term "Order" --context=billing

# With body content (non-interactive / agent use)
arc add decision "Use SQLite" --body='# Decision: Use SQLite

## Context
Need offline persistence.

## Decision
Use SQLite as embedded DB.

## Consequences
Single file, no concurrent writes.'

# Body from file or stdin
echo "..." | arc add assumption "Low latency" --body-file=-
arc add requirement "Auth" --body-file=auth-req.md
```

### 3. Link entities iteratively

Relationships are often discovered after the fact. Use `link` to connect existing entities:

```bash
# Link a decision to a requirement that drives it
arc link D-001 R-002

# Link a decision to another decision it enables
arc link D-001 D-002 --type=enables

# Mark a decision as superseding an older one (auto-marks old as superseded)
arc link D-003 D-001 --type=supersedes

# Mark two requirements as conflicting
arc link R-002 R-003 --type=conflicts_with

# Link a requirement to the stakeholder who requested it
arc link R-001 S-001 --type=requested_by

# Link a decision to the stakeholder it affects
arc link D-003 S-002 --type=affects

# Link a risk to the decision that mitigates it
arc link K-001 D-005 --type=mitigated_by
```

Edge type is auto-inferred when unambiguous:

- decision → requirement = `driven_by`
- decision → assumption = `driven_by`
- decision → decision = ambiguous, must specify `--type enables` or `--type supersedes`
- requirement → requirement = ambiguous, must specify `--type derived_from` or `--type conflicts_with`
- idea → any entity = `inspired_by`

### 4. Analyze

```bash
# What backs this decision? Show full dependency tree.
arc trace D-001

# What would break if this assumption is wrong?
arc impact A-001

# Full health check: orphans, contradictions, dangling refs, unvalidated assumptions, gaps
arc check

# What should I work on? Categorizes requirements by readiness.
arc next

# Everything I need to implement R-003.
arc context R-003 --shallow

# Machine-readable output
arc next --format json
arc context R-003 --format json

# Stricter: treat warnings (unvalidated assumptions, orphan requirements) as errors
arc check --strict

# Machine-readable output for CI
arc check --format json

# Search by text or modifiers
arc query "sqlite"
arc query "type:decision status:accepted"
arc query "driven_by:R-001"
arc query "tag:storage"
```

#### `arc next` categories

The command outputs requirements in these categories (no ordering — the agent decides priority):

| Category           | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ready to implement | Requirement has accepted decisions AND use cases                |
| Needs use cases    | Requirement has accepted decisions but no use cases             |
| Needs design       | Requirement has no accepted decisions                           |
| Risky assumptions  | Unvalidated assumptions backing accepted decisions              |
| Orphan decisions   | Decisions with no driven_by (no backing requirement/assumption) |

#### `arc context` options

| Flag               | Effect                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--shallow`        | One-hop only — direct relationships. Default is full transitive closure. |
| `--format json`    | Machine-readable output                                                  |
| `--context <name>` | Filter by context                                                        |

Bundles the entity with all related: decisions, use cases, assumptions, risks, requirements, visions.

### 5. Validate assumptions, promote ideas

```bash
arc validate A-001        # Mark as validated
arc promote A-001         # Promote validated assumption to a formal requirement
arc invalidate A-001      # Mark as invalidated (shows cascade of affected decisions)

# Ideas can be promoted to either requirements or decisions
arc promote I-001                # Default: promotes to requirement
arc promote I-001 --to decision  # Promotes to a proposed decision
```

### 6. Visualize

```bash
arc graph                    # Mermaid (default, renders in GitHub)
arc graph --format dot       # Graphviz DOT format
arc graph --format ascii     # Plain text tree
```

Pipe Mermaid output into a markdown file for GitHub rendering. Pipe DOT into `dot -Tpng` for images.

## File Format

Each entity is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter in `.arc/`:

```markdown
---
id: D-001
title: "Use SQLite for local storage"
status: accepted
date: 2026-04-30
tags: [storage, database]
driven_by: [R-001, A-003]
---

# Decision: Use SQLite for local storage

## Context

We need local persistence that works offline.

## Decision

Use SQLite as the embedded database.

## Consequences

- Single file, easy to version and backup
- No concurrent write support across processes
```

The body is freeform markdown. The frontmatter is the structured data ARC reads. You can `arc edit D-001` to open in `$EDITOR`, or edit the files directly.

## Best Practices for Agents

### When recording decisions

1. **Always set `driven_by`** — a decision without backing is an orphan. If you can't find a requirement or assumption that drives it, add one first.
2. **Be specific in titles** — "Use SQLite" is better than "Database choice".
3. **Fill in the body** — Context, Decision, Consequences is the standard template. Even a single sentence in each section is valuable.
4. **Tag consistently** — tags enable `arc query "tag:storage"` to find related entities.

### When adding requirements

1. **Make them testable** — "System responds in under 200ms" is better than "System is fast".
2. **Decompose large requirements** — use `derived_from` to link sub-requirements to their parent.
3. **Declare conflicts** — if two requirements contradict, `arc link R-002 R-003 --type=conflicts_with`.
4. **Build hierarchies, not stars** — link pillar requirements directly to the vision (V-xxx), then derive supporting requirements from pillars. `arc check` walks the chain transitively, so every requirement connected to a pillar is automatically connected to the vision. Don't fan-link every requirement directly to the vision — that flattens the dependency structure.

### When linking to visions

1. **One vision per project** (typically). If you have two distinct workstreams, a second vision is fine.
2. **Link pillar requirements directly** — the core capabilities that define what the system IS. These are the handful of requirements that you'd point to if someone asked "what is this project?".
3. **Derive supporting requirements from pillars** — requirements for specific features, CLI flags, file formats etc. should `derived_from` the pillar they serve.
4. **The check is transitive** — `arc check` walks the `derived_from` chain to reach the vision. A requirement linked to a pillar linked to a vision is not warned about. Only truly disconnected requirements get flagged.
5. **Vision check is gated** — warnings about requirements not linked to any vision only appear when at least one vision exists. Projects without visions are not noisy.

### When capturing assumptions

1. **State them explicitly** — implicit assumptions are the most dangerous kind. If you hear "we assume..." or "it should be fine because...", capture it.
2. **Note how to validate** — the body template has a "Validation" section. Fill it in.
3. **Track their status** — unvalidated assumptions backing accepted decisions are a risk. Run `arc check` regularly.

### When analyzing

1. **Run `arc check` before finishing a session** — surface orphans and contradictions early.
2. **Use `arc trace` to justify decisions** — if a stakeholder asks "why did we choose X?", the trace tells the full story.
3. **Use `arc impact` before changing assumptions** — know what breaks before you invalidate.
4. **Use `arc next` to decide what to work on** — categorizes requirements by readiness (ready, needs use cases, needs design) and flags risky assumptions and orphan decisions.
5. **Use `arc context <id>` before implementing** — bundles the entity with all related decisions, assumptions, risks, and requirements. One call instead of five.

## Query Reference

```
arc query "sqlite"                        Fuzzy text search (title, body, tags, ID)
arc query "type:decision"                 Filter by entity type
arc query "status:accepted"               Filter by status
arc query "tag:storage"                   Filter by tag
arc query "driven_by:R-001"              Find decisions driven by a specific requirement
arc query "derived_from:R-001"           Find requirements derived from another
arc query "id:D-001"                     Find by exact or partial ID
arc query "inspired_by:D-001"             Find ideas inspired by an entity
arc query "type:idea status:explore"       Find ideas in exploration
arc query "type:decision status:accepted sqlite"  Combine modifiers + text
```

## CI Integration

```bash
# In a git pre-commit hook
arc check --strict

# In GitHub Actions
arc check --format json
```

Exit code 0 = clean. Exit code 1 = issues found (or warnings in strict mode).

## Agent Integration

ARC is designed for seamless agent use. All commands work non-interactively and produce structured output:

```bash
# Machine-readable health check for CI/agents
arc check --format json

# Structured output for all list/show commands
arc list --format json
arc show D-001
arc trace D-001
arc impact A-001

# Driver commands — what to work on and implementation context
arc next --format json
arc context R-001 --shallow --format json

# Non-interactive add (no TTY prompts)
arc add decision "Use SQLite" --driven-by="R-001" --status=accepted --body="..."

# Query with structured modifiers
arc query "type:decision status:accepted"
```

### Skill file installation

ARC ships a skill file that teaches agents how to use it:

```bash
# Print the skill file to stdout (pipe to your agent's skill directory)
arc skill

# Install directly into the current project's .hermes/skills/ directory
arc skill --install
```

The skill file covers all entity types, relationships, lifecycles, workflow patterns, and best practices for agent-driven architecture documentation.

### Agent onboarding with AGENTS.md

For projects that use AGENTS.md (or similar agent instruction files), ARC can append a concise usage section:

```bash
arc init-agent
```

This appends a structured ARC reference to `AGENTS.md` in the current project, including commands, entity types, relationships, and workflow rules. It's idempotent — running it again updates the ARC section without duplicating it.
